# While Loop - Lab

### Tasks:

01. Old Books:

Annie goes to her hometown after a very long time abroad. On her way home, she sees her grandmother's old library and remembers her favorite book. Help Annie by writing a program in which she enters the book she is looking for (text). Until Annie finds her favorite book or checks out all the books in the library, the program should read the name of each subsequent book (text) she checks out on a new line. The library is out of books when you get the text "No More Books".
• If the book you are looking for is not found, print two lines:
• "The book you search is not here!"
• "You checked {number} books."
• If the book you are looking for is found, print one line:
◦ "You checked {number} books and found it."

02. Exam Preparation:

Write a program in which Marin solves exam problems until he receives the message "Enough" from his lecturer. For each solved problem, he receives a grade. The program should stop reading data at the command "Enough" or if Marin receives the specified number of unsatisfactory grades. Any grade that is less than or equal to 4 is unsatisfactory.

Input:

• On the first line - number of unsatisfactory grades - integer;

• Then, two lines are repeatedly read:

◦ Name of problem - text;

• Grade - integer in the interval [2…6]

Output:

• If Marin reaches the command "Enough", print on 3 lines:

• "Average score: {average score}"

• "Number of problems: {number of all problems}"

◦ "Last problem: {name of the last problem}"

• If he receives the specified number of unsatisfactory grades:

• "You need a break, {number of unsatisfactory grades} poor grades."

The average grade should be formatted to the second decimal place.
